## Why do I write these in English ?
As Chinese, why do I write articles and codes in English?
The primitive reasons are the following:
1. English is the most commonly used language in the world.
2. To improve my English skills in reading and writing.
3. An media to communicate with others.

Unfortunately, My English is **poor**, so **never mind**.

**I will fix those articles irregularly until they are acceptable**.

## Leetcode related
Some sections may be related with `leetcode` problems, whose implementations can be found in:
-  [leetcode](https://github.com/hsjfans/leetcode)
-  [online judge](https://github.com/hsjfans/Online-Judge#Leetcode)
-  [pat](https://github.com/hsjfans/postgraduate-retest)

This repository contains fundamental data structures and algorithms. 

Each of them has its own separated `README.MD`,implementations and some simple instances of applications ;

**Note that** ⚠️ this project is aimed at learning and researching purposes only, Using in production isn't the purpose .

## Data Structures
> The data structure is the basic skeleton of the computer system, which is a collection of elements that have one or more specific relationships with each other,contains some corresponding functions or methods also.
